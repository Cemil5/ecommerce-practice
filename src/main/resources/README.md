In this task;

The main target is to enhance the understanding and the usage of functional interfaces with lambda expressions and to create custom sorting behavior with a comparator interface. Let's follow the instructions below...


1- Make your all class materials ready to review when needed. For example; when you try to create some method related to lambda, if you need, use the lambda slides of Ozzy.

2- All the tasks are inside the Main class.

3- Either you can use your custom functional interfaces or in build java functional interfaces like:
    - Consumer
    - Function
    - Predicate
    - Supplier
    - Bi consumer
    - Bi function
    - and the others ......

4- After getting the solution of the lambda expression, if the double colon operator is applicable then provide that syntax and comment on the lambda version. (to have a strong understanding of double colon and lambda, do not hesitate to review the class slides of Ozzy - try to understand logic with presentation)

5- If you need, please review the class slides of Ozzy for the sort related tasks.

6- Define all the necessary methods inside service class as a static, and implement the task inside main class

7- At the end of this task it is anticipated that you have a great review of the lambda, functional interface, and sorting.
